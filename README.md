# Culinary Compass: Recipe Finder App

Culinary Compass is a dynamic web application designed to help users discover and explore a vast array of recipes from around the world. It fetches recipe data from an external API, providing detailed information about ingredients, instructions, and more. This project showcases my skills in building interactive front-end applications with modern JavaScript libraries.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Recipe Search:** Easily search for recipes by name, ingredient, or cuisine.
* **Detailed Recipe View:** Get comprehensive information for each recipe, including ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, and sometimes nutritional facts.
* **External API Integration:** Seamlessly fetches data from a third-party recipe API.
* **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a consistent and appealing user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **React.js:** For building a powerful and modular user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The core language for application logic.
* **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **External API:** Utilizes a public recipe API (e.g., TheMealDB API, Edamam, Spoonacular) for recipe data.
